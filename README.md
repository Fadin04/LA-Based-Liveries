# Notice

* _The (LAPD) 2018 Taurus and (LAPD) 2018 Charger liveries are low quality due to the original release of the template regarding the 2 vehicles. I will update this in the future and add more liveries / update the quality to be better._

* _The LSSD Vehicles are going to have more added, the current that have an "❌" are vehicles that are going to be added in the near future!_

# How to Install

1. To install these vehicles / liveries you will need OPENIV - https://openiv.com/
2. Download the vehicles (Addon / Replacement)
3. Install them into your server based off of how the original creator provided.
4. Open the .ytd file of whatever vehicle you want to change 1st.
5. Replace <vehicleName>_sign_1 with the LAPD based liveries.
6. Start your game and you should see the new liveries on the vehicles.
