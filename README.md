# How to Install everything:
* Starting off, you would want to probably use a MODDING DLC package which you can find [here](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/modding-dlc-pack-v), but this would allow you to center all modded vehicles and weapons into 1 area instead of using differnet packs created by GTA 5.


### How to install the modding DLC:
1. Dowload the zipped file from GTA5Mods.com.
2. Open the zipped file (Recommend using [Winrar]() as it makes opening these easier.)
3. Open up [OpenIV](https://openiv.com/) and turn on edit mode (Image on where it is located shown below to those that can't find it)

4. Drag the Modding.oiv file into OpenIV, this will open the package installer via openiv.
5. Click Install > Mods > Install (**ALWAYS INSTALL MODS INTO YOUR MODS FOLDER! NEVER YOUR ORIGINAL GAME FILES**)
6. Navigate to this path: ```Mods > > update > x64 > dlcpacks > MODDING```
* You can find the VEHICLES path here: 
```Mods > updates > x64 > dlcpacks > MODDING > dlc.rpf > levels > gta5 > vehicles > vehicles.rpf```
```V\mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\MODDING\dlc.rpf\x64\levels\gta5\vehicles\vehicles.rpf\```

* You can find the WEAPONS path here:
```Mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks > MODDING > dlc.rpf > x64 > models > cdimages```
```v\mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\MODDING\dlc.rpf\x64\models\cdimages\```

* ***

### How to install vehicles included:

* This section will go over how to install the vehicle\(s) given that the livery package goes off of.

<details><summary>How to Install LAPD Vehicles</summary>

### How to install the addon version of the LSSD vehicle pack - Created by Allen Development:

1. Download the Zipped file provided and open the folder.
2. Whilst on the main directory for the zipped file, the main folders you will need are the ELS files and the lib1pack located in the MODLES DLC folder.
3. Navigate to the following path located below:
```
V\mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\
```
4. Drag the folder ``lib1pack`` into the dlcpack location.
5. Head back to the mods directory and navigate to the following path:
```css
V\mods\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml
```
6. After opening the dlclist.xml file __IN EDIT MODE__ type the following line at the bottom under the last dlclist calling.
```css
<Item>dlcpacks:/lib1pack/</Item>
```
